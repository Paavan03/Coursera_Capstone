📊 Coursera Capstone Project – IBM Data Science

This repository contains my work for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project on Coursera. The project focuses on data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and machine learning to solve a real-world location intelligence problem.



🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this capstone is to apply data science methodologies to explore, analyze, and model geographic and business data. The project includes:

Data acquisition using APIs and web scraping

Data wrangling and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualization with maps and plots

Clustering and machine learning models

Insights and reporting

The main case study uses Toronto neighborhood data to analyze and cluster locations based on venue categories.
